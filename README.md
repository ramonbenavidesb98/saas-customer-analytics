# SaaS Customer & Revenue Analytics

An end-to-end analytics project analyzing customer behavior, revenue trends, and churn across a B2B SaaS business. Covers MRR decomposition, cohort retention analysis, acquisition channel performance, customer segmentation, and a churn prediction model.

Built to demonstrate production-ready analytics skills applicable to SaaS, fintech, e-commerce, and any data-driven business with recurring revenue or customer lifecycle data.

## Business Questions Answered

| Question | Method |
|---|---|
| How is MRR growing — and what's driving it? | MRR trend + event decomposition |
| Which plans retain customers best? | Churn rate & tenure by plan |
| Which acquisition channels bring the highest-value customers? | Channel performance analysis |
| Are newer cohorts retaining better than older ones? | Cohort retention heatmap |
| Which customers are most at risk of churning? | Gradient Boosting churn model (AUC: 0.827) |
| How should we segment our customer base? | RFM-style segmentation |

---

## Key Findings

- **Total MRR: $5.26M** across 1,438 active customers
- **Enterprise plan churn is 4-5x lower** than Starter — upsell path is the highest-leverage retention lever
- **Referral channel** produces the longest customer tenure and lowest churn — worth investing in
- **Cohort retention stabilizes around month 6** — customers who survive 6 months have significantly higher LTV
- **Churn prediction model (AUC 0.827)** — NPS score, tenure, and plan are the strongest predictors
- **17% of active customers classified as "At Risk"** based on low NPS — actionable intervention target
